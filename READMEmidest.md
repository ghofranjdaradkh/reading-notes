## Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice. 


In software development,  enhancing your technical skills not only elevates the quality of your software but also opens doors to new horizons and multidisciplinary knowledge. However, this progress is no accident; while repetitive tasks can be tempting, genuine improvement requires deliberate practice.

Deliberate practice,  is a methodical approach to honing your skills. It's about purposefully pushing yourself beyond comfort, repeating tasks frequently, obtaining continuous feedback, tackling demanding mental challenges, setting meaningful goals, and persistently seeking improvement. In a field where self-teaching is the norm, it's up to you to identify challenges that align with these principles and guide your own growth.
In deliberate practice, choose challenges that stretch your abilities, revisit them to apply skills broadly, and assess both technical and subjective aspects. Deliberate practice demands mental effort, leading to exhaustion . 


## The power of believing that you can improve

Carol Dweck researches “growth mindset” — the idea that we can grow our brain's capacity to learn and to solve problems. In this talk, she describes two ways to think about a problem that’s slightly too hard for you to solve.

she said :
The innovative approach of labeling academic challenges as "Not Yet" rather than failures illustrates the transformative power of a growth mindset. Embracing the idea of continuous learning and improvement, this concept reframes setbacks as stepping stones on a journey toward mastery. The experiences  vividly underscore the stark difference between a fixed mindset that shies away from difficulty and a growth mindset that thrives on challenges, leading to enhanced resilience, perseverance, and ultimately, success.

By instilling the principles of the growth mindset, we can reshape education and personal development. Encouraging a focus on the process, celebrating effort, strategies, and progress over immediate outcomes, and cultivating a mindset where "yet" signifies a path forward, we empower individuals to overcome obstacles and reach their full potential. 
Through this shift, we not only enrich individual lives but also address longstanding inequalities in education.

## A kinder, gentler philosophy of success:
our modern lives are often filled with career anxieties and moments of uncertainty. While the pursuit of success is natural, it's crucial to recognize the complex factors that shape our notions of achievement. External pressures, like societal snobbery and the pervasive meritocracy ideal, can lead to feelings of inadequacy and fear of failure. Amidst this, the concept of success needs personal scrutiny – it should align with our authentic desires rather than societal norms. To find genuine fulfillment, we must redefine success on our terms and embrace the inherent imperfections and setbacks that come with it.

Once we understand our emotions, we are better able to manage them in positive ways.


Measuring emotional intelligence entails evaluating our capacity to comprehend, interpret, and effectively regulate our emotions as well as those of others.

we become equipped to identify and navigate our feelings, leading to more deliberate and constructive emotional responses. This understanding empowers us to manage our emotions in ways that promote healthier interactions, improved decision-making, and overall well-being, fostering a positive and harmonious approach to both personal and professional contexts.






## "Bias Self-Assessment"
 refers to the tendency or inclination of an individual to assess themselves or their abilities in a way that is influenced by their own biases or preconceived notions. 


It highlights the potential for people to inaccurately evaluate their own skills, qualities, or performance due to personal beliefs, preferences. This bias can lead to an inflated or deflated perception of one's abilities, potentially affecting decision-making, self-improvement efforts, and interactions with others.
