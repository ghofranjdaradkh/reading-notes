Q1.Explain the difference between an object and a class.
<pre>

Class:
A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects  It defines the structure, state, and behavior that objects of that class will have .When you create an object from a class, you're essentially creating an instance of that class, and the object inherits the characteristics defined in the class,It defines the structure, attributes (state), and methods (behavior) that objects of that class will have.

object:An object is a specific instance of a class,it is described as a "software bundle" because it combines data or attributes (state) and functions or actions(behavior) that operate on the data.it  has own unique state and can perform actions defined by the class.

Q4.Explain the significance of a constructor for a class.
<pre>
constructor: very special type or method is used to create object.
It's responsible for setting up the object with initial values and making sure it's ready to be used. Just like how you might need to prepare things before using them, a constructor ensures that an object is properly set up from the moment it's created. It helps keep things organized, makes sure everything starts off correctly, and is an important part of creating and using objects in programming.

}

Q6.What is the value of the binary number 1101?
<pre>

solution :(1 * 2^3) + (1 * 2^2) + (0 * 2^1) + (1 * 2^0) = 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13
Binary Numbers:
Base-2 numbering system using only two digits: 0 and 1.
Example: 1010 (binary) represents 1 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0 = 10 (decimal).

Decimal Numbers:

Base-10 numbering system using digits from 0 to 9.
Example: 123 (decimal) represents 1 * 10^2 + 2 * 10^1 + 3 * 10^0 = 123 (decimal).

Hexadecimal Numbers:

Base-16 numbering system using digits from 0 to 9 and letters A to F (representing values 10 to 15).
Example: 1A (hexadecimal) represents 1 * 16^1 + 10 * 16^0 = 26 (decimal).

Q7.Write the number 52 in binary. Write it in hexidecimal.
<pre>
In Binary :110100
In hexidecimal:34
