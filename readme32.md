What makes an API RESTful?

A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) follows a set of architectural constraints and principles to provide a uniform way of interacting with resources over the web

Stateless: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server doesn't store any client state between requests.

Client-Server: The client and server are separate entities that communicate over a stateless protocol. This separation of concerns improves scalability and simplifies the architecture.

Uniform Interface: REST APIs have a consistent and well-defined set of methods (HTTP verbs) for interacting with resources, such as GET (retrieve data), POST (create data), PUT (update data), and DELETE (remove data).

Resource-Based: In a RESTful API, resources (e.g., data objects) are identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), and clients interact with these resources using the HTTP methods.

What is the benefit of using GraphQL? Any downsides?

GraphQL offers significant advantages in terms of efficiency and flexibility, but it also comes with some challenges, such as a learning curve and the need for careful consideration of security and caching strategies.




Describe “serverless” to a new 301 Code Fellows student.

Serverless computing is a cloud-based model that allows developers to build applications without the need to manage servers. It's event-driven, cost-effective (you pay only for what you use), and encourages the creation of small, independent functions that can scale automatically. While it simplifies development, it's important to be aware of potential vendor lock-in and occasional cold start latency for functions.
