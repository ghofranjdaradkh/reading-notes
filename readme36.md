It is advisable to check the current auth session in a relevant lifecycle method of your application, such as the onCreate method of the MainActivity for testing purposes. However, for a more production-ready approach, you might want to integrate the auth session check in a dedicated authentication manager or a splash screen to ensure seamless user authentication handling throughout the app.

To push your changes to the cloud using Amplify, you can use the following commands:

Use the Amplify Studio console to configure authentication.
Execute Amplify.configure() in your code to initialize the Amplify library.
Navigate to your project directory and run amplify push in the terminal to start provisioning auth resources in the backend.
Ensure you add the Auth plugin before calling Amplify.configure to set up authentication properly.

Amplify Auth serves as a crucial component in your application by providing a comprehensive interface for user authentication. Beyond the foundational role of enabling users to sign in, Amplify Auth handles the necessary authorization seamlessly for other Amplify categories. It comes with default support for Amazon Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool, offering a robust and secure authentication solution. The Amplify CLI facilitates the creation and configuration of the auth category, ensuring a streamlined setup of authentication providers for your application.
