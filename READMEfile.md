## Things I want to know more about
## Reading class 2:

## This topic it very important , its the basics in java languages , arrays and loops able us to manipulate and process data, build complex algorithms, and optimize code execution.

## I used the reading sources that spacified in canvas and this for built in arrays

Q1 .Use an analogy to explain Built-In packages. Give examples:
<pre>
1.java.lang: its automatically imported ,it included classes like String ,Math and Object .
2. java.util : it used for data structure like Array list .
java.io : it used to handling input and output operations
</pre>

Q2. Explain the steps for creating a new package in IntelliJ.
<pre>
Right-click on the source folder.
Go to new and then package.
Enter the package name in the pop-up box
click ok .
</pre>

Q3. Which loop types use a loop counter?
<pre>
For Loop :it consist of three parts :
Initialization : initialize the loop counter
Condition: If the condition true, the loop body is executed; otherwise it outside the loop
iteration :used to update the loop counter

</pre>
Q4. Explain the difference between While and Do-While loops.
<pre>
do-while and while iterate the elements for infinite number of times but in do-while code excuted at least once whether condition is true or false 
</pre>
Q5.Describe 3 built-in methods for Arrays.

<pre>
Arrays.toString(): This method converts an array into a human-readable string representation, making it easier to print or display array contents.
Arrays.sort():used to sort the elements of an array in ascending order.
Arrays.equals():used to check if two arrays are equal in length and have the same elements.
</pre>
Q6. How is the size of an array determined in Java?
<pre>
when creating the array you must specify its size >>using new dataType[arraySize].
</pre>
