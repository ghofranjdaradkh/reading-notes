## Data Structures and Algorithms:



# Data structure :data organization , management and storage format that enable efficient access and modification.
Data structures in Java optimize data storage and access, improving efficiency and scalability of algorithms, leading to faster and well-organized code.

Types of Data structure :

1.primitive data structure : integer, float, character , pointers.

2.Non primitive data structure : 

-linear data structure (Linear List): Arrays , Linked list , Stack , Queue.

-Non Linear data structure: Trees , Graph .

What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
<pre>
One of the most important considerations when selecting a data structure to solve a specific problem is  is the performance in terms of both time complexity and space complexity.

Time complexity :How long an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size.

in the time complexity we have three cases :Best case , average case and worst case >> we deal always with worst case(Big O) to manipulate it .

Space complexity: how much memory or space an algorithm uses as a function of the input size.
</pre>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2.How can we ensure that we’ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
<pre>
Every recursive function have two part : base case and recursive  case .

the recursive case that when the function call it self, and the base case when the function stop recursion . so we must add the base case to the recursive function to avoid infinite  recursive call .
</pre>

## Things I want to know more about:
I want to learn all type of data structure and how to deal with it .
Also able to specify the type of data structure depending on the case , and I want to be able to specify the time complexity  for each problem
