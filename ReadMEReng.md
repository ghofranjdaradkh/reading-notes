## How to think like a programmer:

 Follow these steps: 
 1. Understand the problem by explaining it in simple terms.
  2. Plan your solution with clear steps.
   3. Divide it into sub-problems and solve them systematically. 
   4. If stuck, debug step by step, maintain curiosity, and find errors. Successful problem-solving involves clarity, planning, breaking down, and a tenacious debugging approach.

# Solving Problems
1.Read the problem completely twice.
2.Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3.Optimize the manual steps.
4.Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5.Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6.Optimize the real code.

## When to Use a 5 Whys Analysis
You can use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems.

## The "5 Whys" technique is a straightforward seven-step process:

Assemble a team with relevant expertise, including a facilitator to maintain focus.

Define the problem clearly through observation and team discussion.

Start with "Why?" and answer with factual accounts, not guesses.

Repeatedly ask "Why?" four more times for each answer.

Know When to Stop.

Address the Root Cause(s).

Monitor Your Measures.

What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
<pre>

1. The first thing explore and Learn:  Research relevant resources, such as documentation, tutorials, or case studies,or videos to acquire new knowledge or techniques that might provide solutions. Continuous learning can lead you to innovative approaches and expand your problem-solving toolkit.
2. Break Down the problem into small problems  , then try to understand and solve the problem step by step this approach makes the problem more approachable and easier to solve .
3.Ask: Ask for advice and ideas from colleagues or connect with someone with experience online.
