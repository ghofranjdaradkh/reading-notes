Benefits of getLastLocation():

Efficiency:

The getLastLocation() method provides a quick way to retrieve the last known location of the device. This can be useful for applications that only need a relatively recent location fix and don't require real-time updates.

Battery Optimization:

It minimizes battery usage because it relies on the last known location, which might be cached and doesn't involve active location computation.

Simplicity:

Using getLastLocation() is straightforward and requires less code compared to managing continuous location updates.




Downsides of getLastLocation():

Accuracy Concerns

Stale Data

Null Location




What about the ‘getCurrentLocation()’ method?

getCurrentLocation() gets a fresher, more accurate location more consistently. However, this method can cause active location computation to occur on the device
